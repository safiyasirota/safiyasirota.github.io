## About

I am a pre-doctoral fellow in Biostatistics at [Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/). I received by B.A. in Mathematics and Psychology from [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/) in 2021.

My research interests include causal inference, social determinants of health, and mental health and substance use disorder treatment. I am also enthusiastic about effective data visualization and data ethics.
